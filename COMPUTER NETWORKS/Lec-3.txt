Protocol and standards :

For communication to occur, the entities must agree on a protocol(set of rules that govern the data communication).
Protocol defines
what is communicated
how it is communicated
when it is communicated
Key elements of a protocol  are
1. syntax : refers to the structure or format of the data, meaning the order in which they r presented.
For ex : simple protocl might expect the first 8 bits of data to be address of the sender, the second 8-bits to be address
of the receiver and rest of the stream to be the message itself.

2. Semantics : refers to the meaning of each scetion of bits.  how a particular pattern to be interpreted, and what action 
is to be taken based on tht interpretation.
For ex: does an address identify the route to be taken or the final destination of the msg?

3. Timing : refers to 2 characteristics : when data should be sent and how fast they can be sent
For ex: if a sender produces data at 100 mbps but the receiver can process data at only 1 mbps, the transmission will
overload the receiver and data will be largely lost.

Standards : A standard provides a model for development that makes it possible for a product to work regardless of the
individual manufacturer.
Data communication standards fall into 2 categories: 
de facto(by fact or by convention) : Proprietary/closed standards(invented by commercial organization as a basis for 
the opn of its products;
; called proprietary bcoz they r wholly owned by the comapny tht invented them; called closed bcoz they close off the
 communication b/w systems produced by different vendors)

 and non proprietary : developed by groups or committees that have passed them into the public domain; open standards bcoz
they open communications between different systems.
de jure(by law or by regulation) : are those that have been legislated by an officially recognized body.



Standars creation committees (ISO internatioanl standard organization)
ITU-T formely CCITT
ANSI (american national standards institute)
IEEE (Insitute of Electrical end Electronics Engineers)
EIA(ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION)


Line configuration: refers to the way two or more communication devices attach to a link.
A link is a physical communication pathway transfers data from one device to another.

P-t-p (point to point) dedicated link between 2 devices
			entire capacity of the channel is reserved for transmission b/w those two devices
			use wire or cables / satellite links or microwaves

Multipoint : (multidrop): in this more than 2 specific devices share a single link.
			capacity of channel is shared, either spatially(if several devices can use the link simultameously)
			 or temporally(if users must take turns, it is a time-shared line configuration)
