Data communication is the exchange of data(in the form of 0s and 1s) between 2 devices via some form of transmission medium
(such as a wire cable)
Data communication is local if communicating devices are in the same building or a similarly restricted geographical area,
and is considered remote if the devices are farther apart.

The effectiveness of data communication system depends on 3 fundamental characteristics:

1. Delivery : The system must deliver data to the correct destination.

2. Accuracy : Data must be delivered accurately. data that has been altered in transmission and left 
              uncorrected r unusable

3. Timeliness : The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data delivered late are useless.
                In the case of video, audio and voice data, timely delivery means delivering data as they are produced,
                in the same order that they are produced, and without significant delay. This type of delivery is called 
                real time transmission.

Components :

1. Message : is the information(data) to be communicated. It can consist of text, no's, pics, sound or video or any 
combination

2. Sender : The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a PC, workstation, telephone, video camera 
            
3. Receiver : The receiver is the device that receives the data message. It can be a PC, workstation,telephone, television,
              video camera 

4. Medium : The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver.
It can consists of twisted pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, laser or radio waves(satellite)

5. Protocol : A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communication. It is an agreement b/w two communicating devices.
without a protocol 2 devices may b connected but not communicating.just a person speaking french cannot be understood by a 
person who speaks only Japanese.


Tansmission mode :

The term transmission mode is used to define the direction of signal flow b/w 2 linked devices.
Simplex Mode :  Communication is Unidirectional, as a one-way street.
		Only one of the 2 stations on a link can trasmit; the other can only receive
		Ex : Keyboards( can only introduce I/P) and Traditional Monitors (can only accept O/P)

Half-Duplex Mode : Each station can transmit and receiving; but not at the same time
		When one device is sending , the other is receiving and vice versa
		It is like a one lane road with 2-directional traffic. while cars are travelling in one direction, cars 
                going in other direction have to wait
		Ex : walkie talkies

Full -Duplex : Both station can transmit and receive simultaneously
	       2-way street with traffic flowing in both the directions at the same time.
	       Ex: Telephone Network; both can talk and listen at the same time.
