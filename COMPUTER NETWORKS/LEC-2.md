Distributed Processing

Networks use distributed processing, in which a task is divided among multiple computers.

Advantages :

1. Security/encapsulation :  a system designer can limit the kind of intercations tht a given user can have with the entire
system. for ex : A bank can allow users access to their own accounts through an ATM without allowing them access to the 
bank's entire database.

2. Distributed d/b : No one system needs to provide storage capacity for the entire d/b.
for ex :: WWW givers users access to information tht may be actually stored and manipulated anywhere on the internet

3. Faster problem solving : Multiple PCs working on parts of prob concurrently often can solve the prob faster than a single
machine

4. Security through redundancy : Multiple PCs running the same pgm at the same time can provide security through redundancy
For ex : In the space shuttle, 3 PCs run the same pgm so tht if one has a h/w error, the other two can override it

5. Collaborative processing : both multiple PCs and multiple users may intercat on a task. 
For ex: In multiuser n/w games the actions of each player are visible to and affect all the others.

Network criteria :

1. Performance : it can be measured in no of ways, transit time(time required for a msg to travel from one device to another)
, response time (elapsed time b/w an inquiry and a response)
The performance of a network depends on no of factors :
No. of users
type of transmission medium
h/w :: affect both the speed and capacity of transmission
s/w ::s/w used to process the data at the sender, receiver, and intermediate nodes


2. Reliability :: n/w relibiality is measured by frequency of failure, the time it takes to recover from a failure and the
n/w's robustness in a catastrophe
Frequency of failure 
recovery time of a n/w after a failure
catastrophe : events as fire, earthquake or theft

3. Security ::
protecting data from unauthorized access and viruses
unauthorized access :: sensitive data must be protected from unauthorized access. protection can be at various levels
			lower level :: user identification codes , pwds
			higher level :: encrypion techniques

viruses a good n/w is protected from viruses by h/w and s/w designed specifically for tht purpose.

Applications :: business, industry and entertainment
1. MArketing and sales :: Marketing professionals use them to collect, exchange and analyze data as per customer needs
			  sales : teleshopping , online reservation services for hotels, airlines
2. Financial services :: credit history searches, foreign exchange, electronic fund transfer
3. Manufacturing ::CAD computer assisted design and computer assisted manufacturing(CAM) :: allows multiple users to work on
		project simultaneously.
4. E-mail
5. Directory services : allows list of files to be stored in a central location to spped worldwide search operations
6. Information services : bulletein boards and data banks
7. electronic data interchange : (EDI) allows business info (docs susch as purchase orders and invoices) tansferred without
using paper
8. Teleconferencing : text conferencing, video conferencing , voice conferencing
9. Cable television 
10. cellular telephone
